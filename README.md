# Pre-work - *iOS Tip Calculator*
______________________________________
**iOS Tip Calculator** is an iOS app that allows a user to quickly calculate their total bill including tip, with a clean, uncluttered interface

Submitted by: **Nathan Miranda**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] Created a Tip Calculator using Xcode that updates the tip and total amounts in real time, using a segmented control
* [X] Successfully pushed my code to github
* [X] Added a README which includes a GIF walkthrough of the app's functionality
* [X] Created an issue on the repo and included /cc @codepathreview in the issue body

The following **optional** features will be implemented:

* [X] Add a Settings Screen to the Tip Calculator
* [X] Enable Navigation between Screens
* [X] Create a Settings View Controller
* [X] Save settings configurations

The following **additional** features will be implemented:

* [ ] Add animations and improve UI!
* [ ] Use locale specific currency and currency thousands separator.
* [X] Add a light/dark color theme to the settings view. In viewWillAppear, update views with the correct theme colors.
* [ ] Make sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
